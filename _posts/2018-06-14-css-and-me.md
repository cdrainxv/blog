# CSS And Me

## Catch-up Time

Since the last post, I have continued steadfast in my resolve to finish the Software Development MicroMasters. As of now I am about to finish the third course and begin the fourth one by the end of the week (possibly even today). I have been enlightened on many aspects of development, testing, and data abstractions in the past month, which I hope to condense into very concise posts for my own reference.

## CSS

I have been working with CSS for some time now, therefore I have always viewed it as a tool in my pocket that I can use anytime. However, in the back of my mind, I knew very well that my skills were very lacking when I would see some css inspired posts on the front page of [codepen](https://codepen.io). Earlier sometime last year I had signed up to practice some css drawing and ui designing using email subscription services like [dailyui](https://dailyui.co) and [dailycssimages](http://dailycssimages.com/), but unfortunately it seems that both services have been discontinued. The remnants of those services have been recorded on twitter and dribble with their respective hashtags, which I use as my own personal challenges to complete, with a great source of inspiration coming from designs on [dribble](https://dribble.com) and [behance](https://behance.com).

As of now I have been doing it for the past week and saving it on my [codepen](https://codepen.io/cdrainxv). I have really dived into how to position elements, integrate flexbox for layouts, and make use of html preprocessors such as pug and markdown. My favorite aspect thus far is relearning the [sass](https://sass-lang.com) language css preprocessor to not only reduce code duplication using features such as mixins, variables, and loops. In the near future I hope to be able to have used and learned every feature of sass and pug, but most importantly I would like to develop my ui skills to the point that I can design some of the amazing ui displayed on some of the sites mentioned above.

## Upcoming

> In the following posts, I hope to provide an overview of what I have learned in the program both in the racket language and in javascript and/or python, as I'm more likely to start my software development career using those languages in some capacity.

I have to postpone those posts until maybe after completing all the courses, but in the mean time I will most likely post some of my css designs workthroughs either through a written post or a video tutorial.

## Afterthoughts

The swelling around my ankles have reduced considerably, although there's still some stiffness in my Achilles tendon and a slight limp in my gait due to my limited mobility.
