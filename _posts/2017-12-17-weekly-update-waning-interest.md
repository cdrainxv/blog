title: 'Weekly Update: Waning Interest'

The title of the post doesn't mean that my interest in pursuing a software
development career is diminishing, but rather that occasionally I don't feel
like learning/doing anything of substance relating to software development, and
would rather just watch binge watch something on Netflix. Taking a night off
however means that it's that much easier to take the following night off as
well. I can understand how **_I_** can view it as a waning interest, whereas
it's mostly likely just not having that resolve and fortitude to prevent
multiple days off back-to-back.

I felt this way the entire week when I didn't post anything, postponing and then
making concessions for my lack of effort, preferring instead to shut off my mind
with streaming television on a nightly basis. I did muster enough energy to
update previous posts, open and close some issues, and complete some previous
projects, but the sole purpose of this blog was to learn something of
significance weekly, and I felt defeated when nothing bore fruit in the form of
a blog entry.

## FOCUS

Recounting from the weekly update from a fortnight ago, I was working on
completing the **anml** library I had started. As of now, it's at v1.0.0 and
published on npm. It's simplicity is shown by the APIs provided for it, but I
hope to expand on it incrementally by adding my animal species, and trait
properties such as diet, lifespan, predators, etc in future updates. Creating
this library also introduced me to new topics related to library creation and
maintenance, such as how to write informative commit messages that can double as
a changelog, how to semantically publish new versions of projects automatically
based on the git messages, and setup continuous integration.

I made some efforts to complete the **vimscript** book, but my interest slowly
waned as I turned towards Progressive Web Apps and VueJS. I previously made an
effort to learn Vue and React simultaneously, but React became my focus due to
its booming job market. This week I made an ambitious goal to create a fullstack
web app using Vue and then recreate it using React. This will hopefully help me
see the entirety (or at least most) of the Vue API, including the vuex,
vue-router, transitions, directives, vuetify, etc. Additionally, this will help solidify
some of my glanced over areas of react including react-router, react-redux, and
redux-forms potentially. I believe this is the point preventing me from applying
to jobs -- that I am not confident enough to complete more complex projects,
considering that I have various projects that implement pieces of a fullstack
project, but not a single one that encompasses **_al_** of them.

## CHANGELOG

Let me reiterate -- I didn't get to doing much this week. However, I did open some issues on my own
projects, as well send pull requests for those issues. I am most proud of the
work I have done on my xkcli project and the fact that I 50+ downloads of from
just these two last weeks! I added this new option so that a user change the
default text color of the title and alt text using the chalk package. Also of
note, I closed the issue where the alt text would be displayed **_before_** the
image. It will most likely be my favorite project for a while, considering I
struggled with it immensely from the onset -- learning async/await, using
commander, writing documentation, and adding new features.

## WEEKLY GOALS

* I'll finish the fullstack Vue project this week, cross my heart and hope to
  die. I will also recreate it in React or least a similar project with the same
  knowledge base acquired from Vue.
* Add significantly more animal species to the **anml** library and create a
  project plan to add the new properties for each animal. These new properties
  will require their own APIs, therefore store these changes in a staging branch
  for v2.0.0.
* Finish backlog of drafts and post them.
* Learn enough about PWAs to create a simple project.


### SEE YOU NEXT WEEK!
