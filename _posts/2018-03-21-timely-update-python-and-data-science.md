# RECAP

I haven't written a blog post since the end of January?! Crazy!!!
What have I been doing since that time? Let me recap it in list form:

1. I made great strides in learning a new language: **python**. Interestingly enough, python was my first official programming language I was introduced to, but I stupidly veered out of programming and only returned back on the path via JavaScript.

2. In learning python (see 1.), I also made conscientious effort to learn some Data Science. This spurred my interest in making use of **Jupyter**, learning the SQL language and some of its various RDMS including **postgresql** and **sqlite3**.

3. I have read countless books, post, articles, etc on anything that piqued my interest -- regardless of how fleeting the interest turned out. These included topics such as blockchain, rust, and go.

I want to get back up to speed checking in at least (bi)weekly and jotting down my thoughts (incoherent or not), mainly for just the act of having a constant thing I do that is solely mine, but also to reflect on what I've learned/done/practiced and put them inside a digital notebook.

One thing I want to focus on now is **Data Science**. I want to write about some things I've learned these past months, such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and data visualization. These work perfectly in a Jupyter environment, but not so much in a markdown formatted blog. However, I believe I have come upon a solution!
