Welcome all and sundry! I am cdrainxv, a self-taught programmer (for the most part) and this page is to not only keep a record of my software development journey, but also to amass a collection of any tips, musings, and knowledge I accrue along this path (lest I forget). Bookmark and/or suscribe to to keeps tabs on my journey. 

Thanks!
