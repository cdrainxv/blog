# RECAP

I have been in the Microverse Remote Software Development program for about two weeks now. Based off of what I learned from researching my new partner, I made the wrong assumption that he would have more extensive experience than myself in software development overall. As much as I would have liked to have formed some kind of mentor-mentee relationship with him and glean all the knowledge I could from him, alas it seems that I have kind of taken the mentor role in some aspects, such as in solving the daily morning algorithms and taking the lead in directing how we tackle some of our projects. I don't take this role casually either, willing to impart all my JS, git, css tips I have gained from my few years of self-study and readings on books, blogs, and tutorials.

#### NEW OR REFINED KNOWLEDGE

- Utilize background-images / linear-gradients
- solidified flex-box and css grid
- solidified understanding of ES6+ classes, imports and exports
- faster approach in solving algorithms; better at explaining approaches and line of thinking

# BENEFITS

I don't profess to **_know_** HTML/CSS, especially when I look at some amazing designs created with some css tools, methodologies, properties, etc that I have never heard about it, but I can say that there are a lot of sites I could clone with the skills I possess. This always leads me to questioning myself, "Well, why haven't you done so?", with the retort being, "If you know you can do something, to whom do you have to prove it?". The answer I always failed to see is, not your colleagues, or future employees, but ultimately **yourself**.

Through the daily structure of the program, I have come to revisit JS, and realize that even though I hadn't used the language in a long while, it came back quite easily with only occasional google searches for specific methods. Furthermore, my css knowledge is being further refined by use everyday. Previously in using css layouts like **flexbox** and/or **css grid**, I would only know a few of the properties, with a majority of them requiring constant lookups in cheatsheets or fumbling around with property values in the chrome developer tools, however through regular usage I find myself walking through small parts of the project with a fully laid out plan for how it should be it should look and how to configure the css.

# NEXT

I realize that I **_could_** write a short post everyday with just the highlights of the day in the program, but after a long day I can't seem to sum up the energy to write. However, I believe a bi-weekly (in this case meaning twice a month) recap of my experience in the program is very much doable. As we are at the tail end of the HTML/CSS section and heading into the Ruby Section, the next few Microverse posts will highlight my new ruby knowledge. On my own time, I have been learning the ruby language using [ruby-koans](http://rubykoans.com/) to get a head-start.

Intermittently splashed between each Microverse post, hopefully, will be the written tutorials and/or video tutorials I have been promising.
